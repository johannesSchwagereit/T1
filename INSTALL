Basic Installation
==================

LINUX or CYGWIN:
The simplest way to compile this package is:  

1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code. 
2. Type `make' to compile the package.
     If you have problems with linking, try to change the line
     beginning with "$(CC) $(LDFLAGS)" to this:
     $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -s -o $(TARGET) $(OBJS) /usr/local/lib/libfltk.a
     (Thanks to Arnd Zapletal (a_zapletal@web.de) for this tip.)
3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  

'make' does not create or copy any files to directories except the
current directory.

The program, named T1, can be executed in any directory.

All other files (*.cpp, *.h, *.o) can be removed after a successful
compile, but don't have to.

In case of compile errors: Check the 'Technical details' in README.

Microsoft VISUAL C++:
1. Install fltk (see fltk-Documentation)
2. Set up new project in Visual C++ as described in fltk-Documentation
